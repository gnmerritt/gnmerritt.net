Me elsewhere on the web:

 *  My [GitHub](https://github.com/gnmerritt) is full of side projects. Most involve uncertainty.
 *  I co-founded [214 Software (domain lapsed)](http://twofourteen.com) with Ben Johnson - we made iOS/Android apps
 *  My [Keybase.io identity](https://keybase.io/gnmerritt), from which you can find my other profiles
 *  And here are some videos I helped [make](http://vimeo.com/4362627) in [college](http://vimeo.com/22967514)

A quick bio:

I've been freelancing since June 2018, helping small software companies to move more
quickly on projects that I feel are good for the world. I've re-built deployment
pipelines, shortening the commit-to-live cycle from weeks to minutes. I've written
glue/plumbing code to make large uploads to S3 proceed smoothly on battery-limited
devices. I've helped large organizations ingest sensor data across campuses of hundreds
of buildings. I'm currently looking for my next project, so if any of this sounds
relevant please head over to my [engagements page](/hire) for more info on working with me.

My last full-time gig was as a full-stack software engineer and software engineering
manager at [Tamr](http://tamr.com). We used machine learning to make ETL a bit
magical and my team in particular worked on the interactive data transformation
engine.

Before that I worked as a full-stack developer at TripAdvisor. I
started on the mobile team, and later worked on the iPad
application and iPad optimized website. I ended up shipping code
everywhere from the Instant Booking checkout flows to the database
that powers commerce BI/analytics to that (now defunct) footer that spams
you with pictures of your Facebook friends.

I'm a 2011 graduate of [Bowdoin College](https://bowdoin.edu) in Brunswick, Maine.
I like brains, computers and math. I'm a former Ultimate Frisbee player and I
and love to ski & sail.

As an undergrad I was in charge of the bipedal motion (robots walking on two legs) code for the [Northern Bites](http://robocup.bowdoin.edu/blog/)
Robocup Team (Standard Platform League), where I [used particle swarm optimization](http://www.bowdoin.edu/student-fellowships/pdf/summer-2010/n-merritt.pdf)
to find a stable bipedal gait for the Aldebaran Nao robot. Additionally, I worked
for Bowdoin's [NOC](http://www.bowdoin.edu/it/) and as a TA for CS 101.
