Me elsewhere on the web:

 *  I co-founded [214 Software](http://twofourteen.com) with Ben Johnson - we made iOS/Android apps!
 *  Music I listen to: [Last.FM](http://www.last.fm/user/satH4n/) or [Spotify](http://open.spotify.com/user/1239066134)
 *  My [Facebook](http://facebook.com/gnmerritt), [Twitter](http://twitter.com/gnmerritt) and [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/profile?viewProfile=&key=25508982&trk=tab_pro)

 *  And some [movies](http://youtube.com/profile?user=satH4n) I'm [partially](http://vimeo.com/4362627) (or completely) [responsible](http://vimeo.com/22967514) for

I'm 27 years old and a 2011 graduate of [Bowdoin
College](http://bowdoin.edu) in Brunswick, Maine. I like brains,
computers and math. I'm a former [Ultimate](http://stonedclown.com)
player and I and love to ski & sail.

I currently work as a full-stack software engineer at [Tamr](http://tamr.com).

In my last gig I worked as a full-stack developer at TripAdvisor. I
started on the mobile team, and later worked exclusively on our iPad
application and iPad optimized website. I ended up working on
everything from the Instant Booking checkout flows to the database
that powers commerce BI/analytics to that (now defunct) footer that spams
you with pictures of your Facebook friends.

My primary research interest is applying insights from both number
theory and modern neuroscience to machine learning. I was in charge of
the low-level motion code for the [Northern
Bites](http://robocup.bowdoin.edu/blog/) Robocup Team (Standard
Platform League), where I [used particle swarm
optimization](http://www.bowdoin.edu/student-fellowships/pdf/summer-2010/n-merritt.pdf)
to find a stable gait for the bipedal Aldebaran Nao
robot. Additionally, I worked for Bowdoin's
[NOC](http://www.bowdoin.edu/it/) and as a TA for Computer Science
101.
