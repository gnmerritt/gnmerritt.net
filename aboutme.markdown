Me elsewhere on the web:

 *  I co-founded [214 Software](http://twofourteen.com) with Ben Johnson - we make apps!
 *  Music I listen to: [Last.FM](http://www.last.fm/user/satH4n/) or [Spotify](http://open.spotify.com/user/1239066134)
 *  My [Facebook](http://facebook.com/gnmerritt), [Twitter](http://twitter.com/gnmerritt) and [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/profile?viewProfile=&key=25508982&trk=tab_pro)
 *  And some [movies](http://youtube.com/profile?user=satH4n) I'm [partially](http://vimeo.com/4362627) (or completely) [responsible](http://vimeo.com/22967514) for

I'm 23 years old and a recent graduate (2011) of [Bowdoin
College](http://bowdoin.edu) in Brunswick, Maine. I like brains,
computers and math. I'm a former [Ultimate](http://stonedclown.com)
player and I and love to ski & sail.

I currently work on the mobile development team at
[TripAdvisor](http://tripadvisor.com) in Newton,
Massachusetts. Although we're a small team, we manage TA's iPhone,
iPad & Android applications, as well as the the mobile optimized
version of the website and a set of RESTful APIs. Working full stack
is a blast, and definitely keeps me on my toes.

My primary research interest is applying insights from both number
theory and modern neurscience to machine learning. I was in charge of
the low-level motion code for the [Northern
Bites](http://robocup.bowdoin.edu/blog/) Robocup Team (Standard
Platform League), where I [used particle swarm
optimization](http://www.bowdoin.edu/student-fellowships/pdf/summer-2010/n-merritt.pdf)
to find a stable gait for the bipedal Aldebaran Nao
robot. Additionally, I worked for Bowdoin's
[NOC](http://www.bowdoin.edu/it/) and as a TA for Computer Science
101.

My PGP fingerprint is: <i>CDED 2183 76BB 8D0B EB3A 0B15 6AD5 C192 F259
6AD4</i> though I assume that if you care about such things you won't be
satisfied with that information alone...

And here's my (out of date!) [resume](/gnmerritt-resume.pdf) in case
you're interested.
