Me elsewhere on the web:

 *  My [GitHub](https://github.com/gnmerritt) is full of frivolous side projects. Most involve uncertainty.
 *  I co-founded [214 Software (domain lapsed)](http://twofourteen.com) with Ben Johnson - we made iOS/Android apps!
 *  My [Keybase.io identity](https://keybase.io/gnmerritt), from which you can find my other profiles
 *  Music I listen to: [Last.FM](https://www.last.fm/user/satH4n/) or [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/user/1239066134)
 *  And some videos I helped [make](http://vimeo.com/4362627) in [college](http://vimeo.com/22967514)

I'm a 2011 graduate of [Bowdoin College](https://bowdoin.edu) in Brunswick, Maine.
I like brains, computers and math. I'm a former Ultimate Frisbee player and I
and love to ski & sail.

My last full-time gig was as a full-stack software engineer and software engineering
manager at [Tamr](http://tamr.com). We used machine learning to make ETL a bit
magical and my team in particular worked on the interactive data transformation
engine.

Previously I worked as a full-stack developer at TripAdvisor. I
started on the mobile team, and later worked exclusively on our iPad
application and iPad optimized website. I ended up working on
everything from the Instant Booking checkout flows to the database
that powers commerce BI/analytics to that (now defunct) footer that spams
you with pictures of your Facebook friends.

I was in charge of the low-level motion code for the [Northern Bites](http://robocup.bowdoin.edu/blog/)
Robocup Team (Standard Platform League), where I [used particle swarm optimization](http://www.bowdoin.edu/student-fellowships/pdf/summer-2010/n-merritt.pdf)
to find a stable bipedal gait for the Aldebaran Nao robot. Additionally, I worked
for Bowdoin's [NOC](http://www.bowdoin.edu/it/) and as a TA for Computer Science
101.
