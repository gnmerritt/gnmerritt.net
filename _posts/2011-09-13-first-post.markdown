SOOooo, I decided to set up a real blog. As great as a bunch of p's
and hr's all smashed together on a page were, I figured it was time
to move to something easier on all of
us. [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/) is a nifty ruby-based
website generator. It runs through a site and makes the pages for you,
so your server doesn't have to generate them dynamically. This is
awesome, since I'm running my blog from a [PogoPlug
Pro](http://www.pogoplug.com/) running [Arch Linux Arm](http://archlinuxarm.org/) Needless to say, it doesn't have a lot
of spare cycles (or memory).

Sorry that this post doesn't have anything more interesting to say, it
exists mostly so I can start styling and laying out the rest of the
blog.
