title: 2nd Annual Fantasy Football Drafting API
---

There are only 43 days until the NFL starts back up again. This means
it's time for all of you data-loving football fans to start getting
ready for the second annual Fantasy Football API League. The league is
a yahoo-defaults (modified roster) fantasy league with a catch -
instead of participating in a regular draft you must write a RESTful
API client to select your team. Before the draft begins you'll be able
to query the API to find out when your picks will occur. During your
designated picking times you'll be able to select one of the remaining
players until your team is complete. For anyone who competed last
year, I've shortened the draft window to 30 seconds per selection but
increased the time size slightly to encourage deeper algorithms.

Same as last year, we'll have the draft on Tuesday, September 2nd
after work. That gives you more than a month to harvest your player
data and figure out your drafting strategy. There will also be a mock
draft a week early to let everybody work kinks out of their clients.

Convinced? Still reading? Great! Go [sign up here](http://draft.gnmerritt.net/)

My reference implementation (sans data) from last year
[is up on GitHub](https://github.com/gnmerritt/fantasy-bot).

Finally, this email wouldn't be complete without a mention of last
year's results. I'd like to congratulate Marcus, who strung together
the only undefeated fantasy football season I've ever seen (including
routing me in the finals, which stung).
