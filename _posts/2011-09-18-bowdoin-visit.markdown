title: Bowdoin visit
layout: post
---

Just got back from a great weekend up at
[Bowdoin](http://bowdoin.edu)! This was my first official post-grad
visit, and I think the strangest part was not being able to get into
buildings (except for the Kanbar computer lab, go figure). Otherwise
it was great to meet some of the new members of the
[Ultimate](http://http://stonedclown.wordpress.com/) and
[Robocup](http://robocup.bowdoin.edu) teams. Looks like things are
continuing on the same as they always have.

Blog-wise, I've finished setting up the basic layout. I've settled on
using markdown for my posts, which are then parsed by
[Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/) and served up as static
HTML by my Pogoplug. I'm toying with the idea of setting up
twitter-based comments, since I don't want to deal with a classical
comment system.

My next task is to fix up the written works section - now that I've
graduated I think it's time to put some of my favorite pieces back
up...

Still love being able to update the site via git post-commit hooks -
after commiting this post I'm just a 
{% highlight bash %} git push deploy {% endhighlight %}
away from having it show up live. Awesome.
