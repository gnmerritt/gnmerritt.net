title: Fantasy Football Drafting API
---

I had a lot of fun writing my poker bot, even though the competition
only lasted for a single season. Inspired by my coworker's excellent
[2013 NFL Draft site](http://mockdraftable.com), I decided to make a
fantasy football drafting API. While the ultimate goal of having a
fully automated fantasy football platform is still a ways off, the API
for picking players in a real-time draft came together in time for the
2013-14 season.

Each fantasy team will write a program to interact with the draft API,
and choose your team. I'll take the results and punch them into a
"real" fantasy provider, probably ESPN or Yahoo. Sound interesting?

All the code is [up on GitHub](http://https://github.com/gnmerritt/autodraft),
pull requests welcome. The API is relatively friendly Django.
