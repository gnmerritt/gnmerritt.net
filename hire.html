<p>
Hello! Bit about me: I'm an experienced full-stack software engineer. I've been
playing with Linux since 2002 and writing software professionally since 2011. I've shipped
iOS and Android apps, consumer-facing websites, enterprise data science and ML tools and on lots of
stacks in between. I believe that a <code>full-stack perspective</code> is vital in today's
rapidly changing technological landscape. I've been around long enough to
recognize patterns and avoid being distracted by shiny new toys. Great software
solves crucial problems for its users, great engineers build at an appropriate
scale and quality level for the problem at hand.
</p>

<p>When I'm not building production code I can also help improve your development
environment itself - let's work together to increase your developer productivity
and morale! I believe that a culture that <code>defaults to automation</code> pays
for itself in software quality, feature development velocity, predictability and
developer quality of life.
</p>

Here are some technical areas I've worked in before. More details are available
on my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gnmerritt">LinkedIn</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/gnmerritt">GitHub</a> profiles or please feel free
to reach out <a href="#interest">directly</a> with questions.
